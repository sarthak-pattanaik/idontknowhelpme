üîß Key Fixes & Improvements Needed:

1. **Fix Design Inconsistencies**
   - Ensure consistent padding, spacing, and font sizes across all pages
   - Buttons should be the same height, have hover/active states, and proper alignment
   - Check typography scale: headlines, body, CTA text should follow a clear hierarchy
   - Mobile responsiveness: all grids, cards, and navbars should be mobile-first and fully functional on small screens

2. **Ensure All Sections Have Non-Blank Content**
   - Replace any empty content blocks, placeholder text, or ‚Äúlorem ipsum‚Äù with meaningful, descriptive dummy text
   - CTA buttons should have real labels like: ‚ÄúStart Free‚Äù, ‚ÄúTry Homemaker‚Äù, ‚ÄúExplore Signals‚Äù
   - Feature lists should not be empty ‚Äî fill them with illustrative bullet points relevant to each product

3. **Make Buttons Functional**
   - All primary CTAs should route to relevant product pages
   - Add smooth scroll for in-page navigation links
   - Ensure nav items and footer links are all wired correctly with `href`

4. **Add Microinteractions**
   - Use Tailwind transitions to add hover/focus states to cards, buttons, links
   - Optionally add smooth fade-ins or scroll animations for section blocks

üé® Logo Redesign Prompt (Generate SVG or Tailwind-based Component)

Create a modern, clean **logo for "idontknowhelpme"**. This should be:

- Bold sans-serif typography (custom font preferred)
- Optionally include a minimal icon or glyph that suggests intelligence, signals, or writing
- Flat design, no gradients or shadows
- Can be an SVG or Tailwind component (`<svg>` in JSX)

Use only original shapes or characters ‚Äî the logo should feel aligned with a modern SaaS AI brand.

- Keep code modular, responsive, and production-grade.
- Use clear semantic HTML + Tailwind utility classes.
- Make sure all buttons, forms, and routes are fully functional in the frontend, even if backend is not wired in yet.
