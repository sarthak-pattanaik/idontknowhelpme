Start building the **Homemaker** product interface — the first real feature module of the idontknowhelpme SaaS platform.

Use the reference UI layout from Blaze.ai as design inspiration (as shown in the provided screenshots), but keep all design and code original.

---

🎯 Objective:
Create a sleek, drag-and-drop AI-powered content management interface where users can:
- View and plan content by date
- See different content formats (Instagram, LinkedIn, Email, etc.)
- Organize posts visually in a timeline/calendar-like UI

---

🧱 Core Layout Requirements (Mimic Blaze-like UI from screenshot):

1. **Left Sidebar**
   - Fixed vertical sidebar with the following navigation items:
     - Home
     - Brand AI
     - Templates
     - Calendar (**active by default**)
     - Analytics
     - Files: Recent, Uploads, Documents
   - Use flat icons for each item (Heroicons or Lucide)

2. **Main View: Content Calendar Layout**
   - Top navigation strip with:
     - Calendar week picker (Today, Prev/Next arrows)
     - Filter dropdowns: Account, Status, Project
     - “+ New Post” button (primary, fixed style)

   - **Weekly timeline layout**
     - Days of the week as columns (Mon–Fri)
     - Time slots (e.g. 10 AM to 5 PM)
     - Each content post is shown as a **card** in a time slot
       - Card includes: thumbnail, platform icon (Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.), caption preview
       - On hover: Show “Edit” or “Delete” buttons

3. **Content Post Card UI**
   - Should contain:
     - Thumbnail image (use a placeholder)
     - Platform badge icon (flat: IG, X, LinkedIn, TikTok, etc.)
     - Title/caption preview
     - Hover state with a subtle shadow or lift

4. **Sticky Header**
   - Show “Calendar”, Filters, Profile icon
   - Clean styling with shadow for separation

🧠 Additional Notes:
- Do NOT use any Blaze code or assets
- This is a real product under development — make the layout original, responsive, and production-grade
- Use Tailwind CSS
- Break it into modular components:
  - `Sidebar.js`
  - `CalendarHeader.js`
  - `CalendarGrid.js`
  - `ContentCard.js`

📦 Folder:
- Save in `/pages/product/homemaker.js`
- Components in `/components/Homemaker/`

🚫 Do not:
- Include AI content generation logic yet
- Use lorem ipsum or blank placeholders
- Copy Blaze design pixel-for-pixel — adapt with originality

✅ Do:
- Match UX patterns for usability
- Keep it clean, readable, and easy to scan
- Prep for later integration with AI-based content templates
